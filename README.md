# Mostly Cryptic

Mostly Cryptic is an online multiplayer card game.  Players are dealt six random image cards.  Each player has a turn at being the storyteller.  When you are the storyteller you submit one of your image cards and a clue.  Other players see your clue and submit one of their image cards that they think matches the clue. All the images are displayed to the players and players try and pick the storyteller's card.

## Game Rules

One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images of the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she chooses a card, makes up a clue, and submits them.

Each other player submits the card in their hands which best matches the clue.

All card pictures are shown face up and every player has to guess and submit which picture was the storyteller's.

If nobody or everybody finds the correct card, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3. Players score 1 point for every vote for their own card.

The game ends when the deck is empty or if a player scores 30 points. In either case, the player with the most points wins the game.
